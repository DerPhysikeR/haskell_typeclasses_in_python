# Haskell Typeclasses in Python

If you struggle to understand certain typeclasses in Haskell, but you are familiar with
Python, the code in this repository might be helpful.

It shows how typeclasses like Functor, Applicative, Semigroup, Monoid, Monad, ... could
be implemented and used in Python.
This is not a recommendation to use code like this in your Python projects, it is just a
fun little experiment for educational purposes.
